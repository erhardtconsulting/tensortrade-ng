# TensorTrade-NG Example Directory

Welcome to the example directory for the **TensorTrade-NG** project! This directory contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks and Python scripts designed to demonstrate the capabilities of TensorTrade-NG.

## Overview

- **Jupyter Notebooks:** The majority of the examples are provided as Jupyter Notebooks, making it easy to interactively explore and understand the code.
- **Designed for Google Colab:** These notebooks are optimized for running on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). While they should work in other environments, you may need to install additional packages if you choose to run them locally.
- **Heavy Machine Learning Tasks:** Some notebooks involve intensive machine learning computations. For these, a free Colab subscription might not suffice. We recommend using a Colab Pro or Pro+ subscription to ensure the tasks can be completed in a reasonable amount of time.

## Getting Started

> No Warranty: These examples are provided "as is" and without any warranty. Please adapt them as necessary to suit your specific needs and goals.

### Running Notebooks on Google Colab

1. Upload the `.ipynb` file to your Google Colab environment.
2. Make sure to install any necessary dependencies using the provided setup code in the notebook cells.
3. Follow the instructions within the notebook to run the examples.

### Running Notebooks Locally

If you prefer to run the notebooks locally, ensure that your environment has the necessary dependencies installed. You can install the required packages by running:

```bash
pip install tensortrade-ng[dev]
```

You might also need to install other packages depending on the specific notebook. Refer to the import statements in each notebook for guidance.
Important Notes

> Colab Subscription: As mentioned earlier, certain notebooks require substantial computational resources. A Colab Pro or Pro+ subscription is highly recommended for these tasks.

### Python Scripts

Alongside the notebooks, this directory includes Python scripts that should work seamlessly with the dependencies installed via:

```bash
pip install tensortrade-ng[dev]
```

Feel free to explore and modify these scripts to gain a deeper understanding of TensorTrade-NG.
